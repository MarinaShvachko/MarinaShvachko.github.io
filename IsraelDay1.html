        <h4>2 May 2019 we landed in Israel: the introduction to our slightly irrational trip. тест</h4>

        <p>Our common sense were telling us that it wasn't a good idea to go to Israel at first days of May. Prices for flights, hotels, transfers were higher than usual because of May's holidays in Russia, a day of Independency in Israel and Shabbat - we landed on Friday and had a return flight on Saturday. However, we wanted to had a holiday, really WANTED. Besides May is the perfect month for having a rest in Israel because of the warm weather and quite warm water.</p>

        <p>We prepared to spand more money, than we would like and overcome some inconviniences. Fortunately, all anxieties were useless. There was a tourist information center at the airport and while we were asking for a city map and taxi service, we found out that we could take a last Friday's train from the airport to Tel-Aviv. After some minutes we bought two tickets, payed by cards, withdrawn some cash (lately we understood that almost for everything is possible to pay by card) and boarded the train.</p>

        <p>We arrived to HaHagana, the nearest train station to historic centre of Tel-Aviv and to our apartment. There wasn't a point to take a taxi, so we reached our apartment by foot. The distance was approximately 2 km through narrow, atmospheric and sometimes overloaded streets. This way not for a grumpy person, think carefful who you are goint to travel with.</p>

        <p>Apartment looked like on photos on AirBnb, may be even better. I'm not sure if I would like to book something on that site again, will tell you about my experience in a section "Our home in Tel-Aviv".</p>

        <p>After having a rest, our study of neighborhood began. First aims were: to eat something, find AM:PM - 24/7 a chain of supermarket that work even in Shabbat. Then, to go to the beach.</p> 


                <p>Summaries:</p>
                <p>1 – Even if there is no information about transport timetable in the Internet, it's a good idea to ask at touristic center </p>
                <p>2 – Cash isn't necessary in Israel. But it could be easy withdrown from an ATM</p>
