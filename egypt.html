            <h4>The hotel Ali baba, Egypt, May 2012.</h4>

                <p>In May my mother and I visited Egypt because there is the warm weather, it needn‚Äôt in advance obtain a vise and we could afford it. We chose a hotel ‚ÄúAli baba‚Äù, I want to tell about and we had a really good vacation, because there was the excellent sea, beach, food, service and big, well-attended territory.</p>

                <p>We arrived at about 11.00 pm, and after leaving our luggage in room, went to look for the sea. To the sea leads to a long straight road. There was very dark and unpeople, so we frightened and decided to find the sea the next day. The room was enough big. Furniture wasn‚Äôt new but all was clean and nice. Our chambermaid leaved us every day four 0,5 bottles with clean water. Late we knew that our room wasn‚Äôt in the most popular place, but decided not to change, because we didn‚Äôt want to pack things into a suitcase again and it could be worse. I don‚Äôt know why we were got the room in that place, may be because we are Russian, may be it‚Äôs just fortuity. Near to our bungalow was growing a tomato, once I saw how cleaners tore small green tomatoes and threw to each other as a joke.</p>

                <p>Our room had one big advantaged: it was near to the restaurants, pool‚Äôs bar, the main part of pool and sport hall (to say true, we didn‚Äôt use one) üôÇ In the hotel there are 3 restaurants and 2 bars. The food was various and tasty. I‚Äôm keen on fresh sheep cheese!!!! Moreover, we could eat in the other hotels‚Äô restaurants and bars and ALL INCLUSIVE!!! It‚Äôs impossible don‚Äôt say about Egypt‚Äôs sweets, that are so tasty! In Egypt only men usually work, so all waiters were men and they work really in an enormous fast rhythm!</p>

                <p>In the middle of our hotel‚Äôs area there is a long, winding swimming pool. It‚Äôs a pity that I hadn‚Äôt the flippers. I could swim along all pool than. The most depth is 1.40 meters. For children there is an another small, round pool. If you go along the pools, you will arrive to the beach. For me it‚Äôs the most important thing, if I have a rest on the sea.</p>

                <p>The sea and the beach were very good! But in the first day we were very surprised when returned to the beach after lunch, the sea moved away may be more than 8 meters! Tides were every day, but for children and for me (I almost can‚Äôt swim) it was fine, because  there were not deep areas, about 2-3 meters long, so we could wallow in very warm water. Sometimes, during flows there were medusas, children played with them, carried in arms or buried into sand. But I was terrified to death, when met them. Some people swam in flippers and mask for seeing corals, especially the German people. Beach‚Äôs staff was polite and nice, I like the way how a worker picked up glasses (I took a photo).</p>

                <p>These are just some additional photos. There are a lot of flowers and different trees on the hotel‚Äôs area. We met some cats. Three kittens lived near to the restaurant. Every evening we saw different shows. It‚Äôs my first article and, I think, I‚Äôll be edit it a lot.</p>


                <p>Summaries:</p>
                <p>1 ‚Äì I need a better camera</p>
                <p>2 ‚Äì It‚Äôs necessary to have different clothes (for restaurant, for disco, walking outside hotel‚Äôs  area)</p>
                <p>3 ‚Äì I won‚Äôt buy anymore a sunscreen Lancaster (it‚Äôs very expensive and spends very fast), I‚Äôll continue using Garnier</p>
                <p>4 ‚Äì If I am in this hotel again, I‚Äôll buy flippers</p>
                <p>5 ‚Äì I should learn English</p>
