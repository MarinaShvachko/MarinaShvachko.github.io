var Israel_day_1 = "<p>Each vacation I think that it would be great to make every day notes about our trip and spends, but through 3-4 days I stop doing it. This time I have my laptop with me and can't invent any reasons not to do it. Hovewer, I realised that this type of vacation doesn't suite for describing each day by day, there is no point to write every day about the same beach, so, I will split notes by topics.</p><p>Today Kostia and I have arrived to Israel. We will be here for 9 days, living in a private apartment that we had reserved on AirBnb.<p>Public transport doesn't work because of the shabbat so we planned to order a taxi. But an employee at a airport's touristic center told us that a train still rides but has only one stop. We are lucky guys, because it was the stop we needed. One one way ticket costs 13,50 for a pearson from Ben-Goureon airport to HaHabashi. We bought tickes by wending machine, payed by card. It's a great benefit of Israel that it is possible to pay by card almost everywhere.</p><p>фотку автомата с продажей билетов</p><p>After arriving to Tel - Aviv we decided to get to the apartment by foot. It took approximately 15-20 minutes. This way may be a quite annoying after a long flight - streets are narrow, overloaded and it's may be unconvinient to drag a luggage. So don't take a nervouse people to this kind of walk.</p>";


var about_vacation = "<p><p>Some days ago I’ve returned from a vacation. It was a great and unusual trip for us and I’m going to tell you about it. I’ll try not to be too boring.</p><p>It was the first time we spent a vacation with our friends. They are a married couple, their names are Lena and Andrey. We planned and booked all our trip together.  Lena wanted to visit Prague because she has been learning the Czech language.  I wanted to see an European country I haven’t visited before. The boys wanted to eat meat and drink beer.</p><p>We were lucky because we bought  really cheap flights.  The flight tickets were so cheap that we didn’t believe in it! A one round trip ticket cost only 5700 rubles  per person (it’s about  90$). As a result we had a flight rout: Ekaterinburg-Moscow-Vienna-Moscow-Ekaterinburg. We spent 5 gays in Budapest, 6 days in Prague (for Lena) and 2 days in Vienna (for me, because I  haven’t been there before) and 1 additional day in Moscow (but at the beginning of our journey  we didn’t suspect about this day).</p><p>So… once upun a time, there were 4 friends … or Part №1 is coming.</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/vacation/vacation.jpg' ></p></p>";

var day1 =" <p><p>It was the first day of our vacations. We had flights from Ekaterinburg to Moscow, from Moscow to Vienna and then a bus from Vienna to Budapest. It took us 12 or 13 hours to get to an apartment in Budapest. As you see our rout wasn’t easy  and short.</p><p>We woke up at night for going to an airport (our friends slept at our flat), I made some sandwiches because nobody wanted to eat a full meal and we went to the airport. Recently all airlines in Russia served a free hot meal during flights, but now they offer only a hot sandwich. So during our first and second flight we ate again only sandwiches. After arriving in Vienna we had 3 hours until the bus and we were enough hungry. The airport of Vienna is comfortable but not big. We easily found our bus stop and decided to have something to eat because in our apartment we had to be only in 10 hours. We found a shop in the airport and can you guess what we bought there? Yes, of course sandwiches (I don’t know why, just we did it despite there were some cafes).</p><p>Our bus was late for 20 minutes and we experienced how strong and cold can be wind in Vienna. When the bus arrived we were happy. The bus was comfortable and warm, there were free coffee, tea and hot chocolate, fresh newspapers. Each passenger had a personal mini-TV. After 3 hours we arrived to Budapest but about it I’ll tell you in part 2.</p><p>A windy day in Vienna</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/vacation/windyDay.jpg' ></p></p>";

var budapest = "<p><p>I’ve decided to combine all days in Budapest into one post. I fell in love with this city during the first time I was there with my mother. Ever since the city became more gorgeous and fascinating.</p><p>I’m fond of architecture of Budapest, bridges, river and food! We lived in a private apartments in the city center, so it was an old building enough with a beautiful winding stair, a tiny private court and a strong smell of sewerage. But its all have their own charm. May be our neighbours were local residents and I hoped we didn’t disturb them. Actually apartments was great. There were 2 bedrooms, a living room with a kitchen and 2 bathrooms. One of the bedrooms was not so comfortable, so we spun a coin who would live in a better one and our friends won.</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/vacation/budapest.jpg' ></p><p>The second  my vivid recollection is a chain of cafe bars – “Hummus Bar”. I adore hummus but in Russia it’s not always easy to find the shop where hummus is sold. It is no use speaking of it, you need to taste it! As well I found ruinpubs in Budapest interesting place enough. They are crowded places in old and ruin buildings. We were only in one ruinbar in the center, the music was modern, there were 2 or more bars and a crowd of different people. I liked a friendly atmosphere of this place.</p><p>The most of our time took walks through the city and one trip to a mountain where you had to use a chair lift to went up . I think this chair lift isn’t a tourist place because there were only a few people. To tell the truth I was dreading this lift because the mountain was high. I sat on the chair lift’s bench with a lot of screams. The view was amasing!</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/vacation/budapest_tf.jpg' ></p><p>The weather was different. Sometimes there were rains. I had to buy a jacket, because it was too cold to wear a raincoat. We didn’t visit any museums and didn’t have time to sightseen some places.  Budapest is the city I want to return again. If I start writing about all places and events in this post, it will be too long to read. I don’t like long posts because I’m not always read them from the start to the end.</p></p>";

var prague = "<p><p>It was our second time in Prague and we decided visited Karlstein, but it was a Monday and to our surprise the castle was closed. We didn’t get sad and went for a walk in the forest near the castl. Additionally, it was our firt experiens to get somewhere in Europe by trains. Sometimes it was raining and we bought special plastic raincoats, so in the forest we looked like gosts.</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/vacation/prague.jpg' ></p><p>In Prague we visited our favourite places and found new ones, sent two postcards and through some days we went to Vienna.</p></p>";

var vienna = "<p><p>I have to finish this part a long time ago. Plenty of events have happend since that vacation, thus, I will be brief. <br><br>When I think about Vienna, I recall four places:</p><p>1. The U.N.O. (United Nations Organization)’s district. I really wanted to visit these buildings, but we didn’t have enough time, moreover our friends weren’t interested in this place, so we just walked through this district. Glassy, tall buildings looked impressively. But I didn’t like the whole design of this place. There are only concrete and glass, straight lines. I did’t feel the “soul” of this place. Undoubtedly, I don’t want to live there.</p><p>2. There is Danube Tower near the U.N.O. area. This tower is 826 feet high. We went up almost all the highest places in all cities we were because my boyfriend enjoys this (while he enjoys views I’m usually scared and dreaming about returning to the first floor). There is a point, on this tower, where all who are crasy enough can jump off, only legs are fixed by a long rope. By the way, it’s not a cheap attraction. I saw how three men jumped one after another. It’s impossible to reproduce their emotions! It worth to see it. Unfortunately, I can’t download a picture because I need to ask a permission from one of these men.</p><p>3. Spareribs (I’m not sure that I wrote this right. I am mean a dish pork’s ribs). Our friend met us in Vienna and we went to a cafe to celebrate our meeting. We ordered a huge dish for all of us. The taste of the dish was fantastic! I didn’t expect that Vienna is a city where it is possible to eat delicious and not expensive.</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/vacation/vienna.jpg' ></p><p>4. And the last place is a combustion plant, that is in the central part of Vienna. Our friend told us that it is really interesting place to see. The plant has bright and unusual design and it’s not harmful for environment and health. However, we didn’t go there because….. yes, right…. we didn’t have time for this. I’m keen on visiting unusual and interesting places like this plant, and each time I think about Vienna I regret that I didn’t see it.To sum up, Vienna is interesting and beautiful city. Medieval architecture and modern concrete desing are mixed there. Also, Vienna is the most convinient city for tourists. In my opinion everyone, who is not good at terrain orientation can understand where he or she is and how to use a subway, because it’s the simpliest subway I’ve used. I mean, it’s possible to go to almost all tourist’s places by the subway. It’s planned so comfortable and clearly.Summary:My mother dreams of visiting Vienna and I hope her dream comes true.Although I didn’t have time to go all places I wanted in Vienna, I  don’t want to go there again, only if it is transit trip.</p></p>";

var spain_with_Kostia = "<p><p>I have never seen an aquarium like this before. Barcelona’s aquarium is huge and there live thousands of fishes, plants and other animals. The most ineresting place in aquarium – a tunnel with glass walls. During wolking in this tunnel you can see how differetn fishes are swimming around and even above you.</p><p>This isn’t me 🙂 This is my boyfriend in tunnel. And he is serious as always.</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/spainKostia/acvarium.jpg' ></p><p>But not only this tunnel impressed me. There were in a one of the rooms an aquarium with octopuses. There were so cute and funny! But I felt myself terribly in that moment because I had eaten fried octopuses the day befor. I really like seafood, but I’m not shure will I eat octopuses in the future or not.</p><p>Octopuses……</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/spainKostia/octopus.jpg' ></p><p>I recommend strongly to visit this aquarium to all people who will stay in Bacelona. We were wolking there more than 2 hours, and there aren’t any benches, so it’s better if you will have a rest before the aquarium. Furthermore the aquarium is almost in the center of the city. There are, near the aquarium, a seafront, an interesting mobile bridge, lots of yachts, a supermarket, cafe. So there are a lot of beautiful places to go.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>– to stop thinking about octopuses and feel pity for them.</p><p></p>– to visit places like this in working days and not in the high tourists season (if there are a lot of people you won’t see all fishes because a crowd)<p>And, as always there are below some pictures that I can’t not to show you:</p><div class='photoContainer'><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/spainKostia/fish.jpg' ></div><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/spainKostia/hors.jpg' ></div></div><p>These are medusa.

//Италия

var rome = "<p><p>We were going to Portugal. When we understood that there aren’t any nonstop flights from my city and the weather in Portugal was getting worse and worse we had decided to visit Austria (it was our spare plan №2). But I actually didn’t want to be in Austria, and may be because of it I suddenly suggested to my mother going to Italy and she suddenly agreed. At the same moment I reserved our trip to Rome (I work like manager of tourism), which included 2 days in Florence. And both of us my mother and I got a bit of shock because of it.</p><p>Usually I don’t research a lot of historic facts about the city which I intended to visit. But in this case I had decided to read about all main sights in Rome. It is more interesting when you are in the place about that you had read and had imagined what in this place was some centuries ago.</p><p>We didn’t know what the weather like in February, we didn’t know the name of our hotels and I didn’t know what clothes I will take (I didn’t lose weight and all my jeans were a little small for me (and they are still small :)) ). Moreover, some months ago I had decided to grow my own colour of hair and the colour of my had was awful. But…..the journey begins!</p><p>I noticed that there aren’t in the internet  any good sites about airports, I mean photos of airports’ halls, discription and prices of dutyfree, interesting characteristics. So I decided to write about it. I departed from Koltsovo. While I was taking photos of airport, I was stopped by police. They prohibited me taking any photos in the airport’s building.</p><p>There are some photos I was able to take.</p><div class='photoContainer'> <div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/airport.jpg' ></div> <div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/airport2.jpg' ></div></div></p><p>Because of the Olympic games, we have bought two bars of chocolate with Olympic simbols. We had decided to gift its to the receptionist. A few days before our trip we had learned the name of our hotel – Smart 4*. I can’t say it is  in the city center but it has a very good location, especially for independent tourists. It’s only 5 minutes on foot from railway terminal, the subway “Termini” and final rout terminal of buses. Some times we had walked to the city center, it took about 20 minutes on foot.</p><p>So….about hotel: I like the hotel very much. There are a modern repair, all furniture and bathroom equipment are new. Breakfast is very tasty (it’s why I didn’t  keep the diet befor this vacations).</p><p><div class='photoContainer'><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/hotel.jpg' ></div><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/sofa.jpg' ></div><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/shower.jpg' ></div><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/bath.jpg' ></div></div></p><p>Why I have said “Rome is the worst plase for my feet”? Because we were walking on foot so much that my legs were ill some days even after I returned to Russia. I wanted to see all places in Rome, just walking through the streets together with local people, admire the Italian scenery and architecture. There are growing my favourite trees in Rome “Italian pine”. I admire them!</p><p>Italian pine:</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/pine.jpg' ></p><p>The first two days in Rome we have walked only on foot. In the second day we had a free excursion to the Vatican and a city sightseeing tour. I thought Vatican’s square should be bigger. Because February isn’t a popular month for tourism, there weren’t any queues. We got in Vatican very quickly. I wish we had more free time, but because of a group’s excursion, we  were running some places in Vatican and, as a result, now I can say I was in Vatican but I can’t say “I saw Vatican”. But we sent a postcard to my sister by Vatican’s post.</p><div class='photoContainer'><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/vatican.jpg' ></div><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/vatican2.jpg' ></div></div><p>It was not during the excursion, but of course we climbed on the Saint Peter’s cathedral’s dome (Basilica di San Pietro). It was easier than climbing on the dome in Florence because we had used an elevator. On the dome, there were so many people, that place was overcrovded!</p><p>The view from the dome:</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/vatican3.jpg' ></p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/vatican4.jpg' ></p><p>There is a river Tiber in the center of Rome. I don’t know why, but i like this river very much! Tiber isn’t the wide river and  water has a strange colour. Two banks are connected by some bridges, almost all of them are old and very beautiful. I admire the way of building in that time, people didn’t know about building as much as now, didn’t have different building materials.</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/river.jpg' ></p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/river2.jpg' ></p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/river3.jpg' ></p><p>On the opposite side of the river is a territory of the ex-ghetto. That urban district has a small difference from all the rest of it. Streets are narrowe and more pictorial.</p><p>We walked and walked, bought in the local market some Italian noodles and different flavouring (incredibly tasty!) but we were so tired so decided to go to our hotel and have a rest. We took a bus and again made sure how convenient are public transport in Rome!</p><div class='photoContainer'><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/market.jpg' ></div><div class='photoInText'><img class = 'imgInText2' src='img/italy/market2.jpg'></div></div><p>I was surprised, but sometimes it was a problem to know on what street we were. Street signs are hight up and not all around. I didn’t see nowhere so much people holding at least two maps in hands and looking around trying understand where they are. But if you get lost it’s not a problem – you can apply to any police. All they speak English and are very polite.</p> <p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/police.jpg'></p> <p>As I have said, in Rome I waned to see all. To my surprise I wasn’t impressed by the Colosseum (may be because of scaffolding that were around the Colosseum). But I was impressed by Pantheon.

To wear only a very comfortable footwear during long pedestrian excursions</p><p>2. Don’t buy “group excursions”</p><p>3. To use public transport</p><p>4. To try writing an article on-line (I mean each evening during a trip)</p><p>5.  To eat in different places (restaurants, cheap bar, fast-food and ets.)</p><p>6. To learn English</p><p>7.

It was early morning in the second day. While we went to the cathedral and looking for the place where we could bought tickets for climbing on this cathedral’s dome we had already got tired and have a rest in a small cafe. There are in Florence the best desserts in Itali!</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/coffee.jpg' ></p><p>The view from the dome was beautiful and I preferred to see then to take photos.

I didn’t buy anything for me and regret about it, because in Rome all leather’s bags and wallets were more expensive and not so interesting. In the center of Florence is a small leather’s market and a local remarkable sight – the pig. All tourists like taking photos with it and making wishes. I like too, but more prefer to take photos with local working people, like this for example:</p><p><img class = 'imgInText' src='img/italy/florence.jpg' ></p><p>What I like most in Florence? I think it’s old houses, narrow cobbled streets, churches, a lot of plotted plants everywhere, and, of course, shop-windows with sweets! One day, I coudn’t restrain from buying a waffle. I wanted to try this waffle so much that I asked to sell it to me immediately without asking the price and it was my mistake!
