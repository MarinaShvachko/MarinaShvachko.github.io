            <h4>Goodby Vietnam, you gifted me a sunny vacationd and a new favourite type of food!</h4>
            <p>The first day in Vietnam was started from eating dumplings, the last day was finished by eating dumplings. This time in a local, not touristic caffee, quite far from a beach. We ordered a taxy to get there and where arrived, people in a cafe was surprised, I think they see tourists not often, especially arrived on an expensive car.</p>
            <p>We ordered some different dumplings to share to each other for testing. There were special sauces to each portion of food, but we mixed them. Through some time a waiter came up frome a kitchen and showed us which sauce combined to the certain dumplings. As a bonuse they brought to us a soup with a "hundred-year egg". It is a black, preserved chiken egg, in a mixture of clay, ash, salt, quicklime and rice hulls for several weeks to several months. It has too specific taste, like a soup itself. Trouly speaking, I wasn't able to eat it all.</p>

            <p>Summaries:</p>
            <p>1 – It's cool to try local food, even if a name of this food doesn't sound deliciously for our culture.</p>
            <p>2 – I need to rebuild my site, develope one stile and think how I could make control better.</p>
            <p>3 – Will not use slider anymore, it's uncomfortable.</p>
