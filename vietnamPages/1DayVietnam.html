        <p>There was cold and snowy when we left Ekaterinburg. Our flight was delayed almost for 4 hours, fortunately we checked the departure time before ordering a taxi to the airport, so we waited in comfort at home eating a big pizza.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, we almost didn't sleep during a flight, but saw a beautiful sunrise frome a plane. Therefore by the time we arrive to the hotel we felt like a zomby. During checking in a porter told us that all tickets for celebrating a New Year at our hotel were already sold, so the question where we should celebrate a NY night is still open.</p>

        <p>Our room is on the 11 floor, with a french balcony and a bathtub instead of a shower. It looks cool but indeed a bathroom is not comfortable, water sprays everywhere while taking a shover. One more interesting thing - bathroom walls are made from glass. Generally, we love our room.</p>

        <p>After all luggage was unpacked we went out for walking and finding something to eat. The first place was a chineese cafe Nha Trang Dimsum House. I think locals sometimes could be surprised how we can eat so much, but we were hungry and it was our first normal meal per day. We payed 300 VND for all: 3 bears, a soup, 4 sets of dumplings, each set contains 3 dumplings. Often, cafe has not a big territory, but has two or more floor in Asia. I love sitting on the second floor, eating and watching what's going on around on a street.</p>

        <p>The most surprising and interesting part of the first day - in the evening, while we were walking along the beach Kostia found some money. There weren't people around and all beach vendors were far away, so we took them.</p>

        <p>There is a sign - money that were received by a chance has to be spent as soon as possible because they won't bring a luck. So, we went to a cafe a spent there everithing, we love to eat.</p>

        <p>Before returning to the hotel we walked through evening's streets with shops and cafes and checked the hotel's swimming pool. It's on the 27 floor. Looks cool at the evening.</p>

                <p>Summaries:</p>
                <p>1 – To sleep in a plain with a travel pillow much more comfortable.</p>
                <p>2 – It's better to have a shower in a room instead of a bath.</p>
