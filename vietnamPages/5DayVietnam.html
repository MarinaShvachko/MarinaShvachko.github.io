            <h4>Vietnamese soup in a real local caffee</h4>
            <p>We didn't do anything interesting today exept of eating in a non touristic caffe where they cook only one meal - soup. All other time we just walking and having a rest at a beach. Waves on the sea got bigger and bigger, only a few peole were brave enough to swim.</p>
            <p>While walking we noticed a local caffe some days ago, as I understood there served only one kind of Vietnamese soup. All tables in that caffe always were occupied by locals. So we decided to have a dinner in that place.</p>
            <p>Caffe was really simple, located at the crossroads. There were some usual wooden tables, plastic chairs and instead of two walls just open space with a view on a road. While we were waiting for our soups locals constantly arriving on their mopeds and bought take away food.</p>
            <p>The most interesting part was the way they serve food. Greens were served separately frome the soup and we had to add it by ourselve directly in a hot bouillon. Also there were differend spicy oils and a cold drink.</p>

            <p>At the evening we walked to a supermarket that located quite far away from a touristic area and on our way back came across a concert. I think local or may be Vietnamese celebrities were performing because local people were filming them and sang along them. There were beautiful firework at the end of the show, I thik it was better that at New Year night.</p>
