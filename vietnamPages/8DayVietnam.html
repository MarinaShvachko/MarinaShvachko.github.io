        <h4>The last day of 2019 year.</h4>

        <p>Today I am doing everithing alone because Kostia has got ill and sleeping all day. It is sad without him. I decided to spend morning in the swimming pool, was there alone almost all time, so had a chance made some beautiful pictures. The hotel provides beach and swimming pool's towels. When I decided to return to the room, there wasn't a pen and I didn't sign that I returned the towel. Interesting if they force me to pay for this towel during check out.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Then I went to the shop for water and bought a bottle of rice milk, I hasn't tried it before. The taste was good, but may be too sweet. It's interestingly that in shops are a lot of Korean food, that rice milk was Korean too. Instead of going to the beach I decided to make a work place on our balcony, truly speaking it doesn't suit at all. But eventually I had a cosy place with a sea view. Moreover, the sky today in amasing, with some clouds but here is 30 celsius degrees. Now is 15:43 but Kostia is still sleeping, hope he will feel good by the evening.</p>

        <p>It looks like I need to go to eat somewhere. By the way, I am writing this sitting on the balcony :) Will show my dinner later.</p>

        <p>So here are: a creape with mozzarella and salamy, a smoothie and a one creape without any addings for Kostia. I paid 155000.</p>

            <p>So, here are last minutes of 2019 year and our New Year 2020 in Vietnam.</p>
            <p> Fortunately, Kostia feels better and we organise a small new year in our room. Some people celebrated it on the beach and there were slightly crowded. Locals don't celebrate NY today, their New Year will be on 20 January. They just sittings with families or friends on the sand, enjoying fresh breeze. We bought two croissant and a Dalat's sparkling wine. There were no fireworks, no shouts, but for me it is a perfect New Year 2020 in calm and friendly atmosphere.</p>
